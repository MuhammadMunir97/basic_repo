step 1:
	I created a project and added some files to it.
Step 2:
	I created a local git repository by the command git init and then added all the files using git add . followed by git commit -m.
Step 3:
	I made a remote repository and pushed the local repository to that repository "https://github.com/MuhammadMunir97/basic_repo"
Step 4: 
	I made some changes to the existing file and then commited the changes to the local repository
Step 5:
	I again pushed the local repo to the remote repo using, git push

ALL the following git commands are bellow:
